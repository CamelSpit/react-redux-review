# react-redux-review
**Overview**: This repo will walk you through a basic Redux setup from scratch. We will make an app to correspond to the video file in this repo ("Redux Animation"). That video is an animation of the image used in the DevMountain pre-class work (see the first pre-class reading "Welcome to React V"). The original presentation link is here: http://slides.com/jenyaterpil/redux-from-twitter-hype-to-production#/ 


## Project Setup
* Navigate (using command line or Finder/File Explorer) to where you want to make your project folder, and create the project folder (e.g. "React Redux Review" or "React Redux Setup Review" etc). 
* CD in the terminal to the folder for your project and run `create-react-app`. (For quick debugging during the review, it is suggested everyone just calls their app `app`.)
* After `create-react-app` runs, `cd` into your project.

## Redux Setup
* Install `redux` and `react-redux`.








If you'd rather just see the entire working version, fork and clone this repository, install dependencies (`npm i`) and run `npm start`.
